# Loan Default Prediction 

> A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default, using financial and demographic data from a real-world credit risk dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** 
Financial institutions need reliable tools to assess credit risk and minimize losses caused by loan defaults. Manually evaluating applications is time-consuming and subjective, while inaccurate risk assessment can lead to high default rates or missed business opportunities. The challenge is to build a data-driven model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on their profile.

**Goal:** 
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive models that classify loan applicants into *default* and *non-default* categories. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

**Methods:** 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and scaling  
- Supervised learning models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
